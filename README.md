# GetPaid — the AngularJS app for tracking and sharing receipts with friends

What is done so far.

- Main view gets all the receipts of the current user from database.
- Swipe left on each receipt in main view will prompt delete receipt. (Placeholder in place for now)
- Detailed receipt view shows the cost of each item within the receipt. Data taken from database.
- UI for adding a new receipt with items and shared users done.
- Added php script which allows us to add a new receipt to the database. Currently the query only adds data into the main receipt table.
